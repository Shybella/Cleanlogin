# Configuration settings for the CleanLogin plugin

# Settings section
settings:
  # Delay in seconds before teleporting the player to a safe location and swapping game modes.
  # This delay allows for any necessary loading or preparation before the action occurs.
  # Example: A 5 second delay means there will be 5 seconds wait time after the player joins before they are teleported.
  teleportDelay: 5

  # Range in blocks to search for a safe location around the player's initial join position.
  # The plugin checks in a cube shaped area, extending this range in all directions (up, down, north, south, east, west) from the player's current location.
  # Example: A range of 5 means the plugin checks an 11x11x11 area centered on the player's location.
  safeLocationRange: 5

# Note: If you're adjusting these settings, please ensure the values are appropriate for your server's needs.
# A higher safeLocationRange might cause slight lag on large servers, while a higher teleportDelay gives more preparation time.
